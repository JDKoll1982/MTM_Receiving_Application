# Copilot Processing

## User Request

Continue clarification work for the MTM Waitlist Application documentation. Current focus is updating `docs/MTM_Waitlist_Application/CLARIFICATION-Database.md` and aligning the other clarification files as needed.

## Context

- Clarification files exist for Analytics, Authentication, Database, Roles/Privileges, UI/UX, and Workflows in `docs/MTM_Waitlist_Application`.
- Memory bank directory not found in the repository; proceeding with available project docs.

## Action Plan

1. [x] Inventory existing clarification files (Analytics, Authentication, Database, Roles/Privileges, UI/UX, Workflows) to identify gaps and inconsistencies. _Dependency: access `docs/MTM_Waitlist_Application` folder._
2. [x] Update `CLARIFICATION-Database.md` with latest decisions, open questions, and next steps. _Dependency: output of Task 1._
3. [x] Align related clarification documents if overlapping topics emerge. _Dependency: outputs of Tasks 1-2._
4. [x] Summarize changes and next actions. _Dependency: completion of Tasks 1-3._

## Execution Notes

- Inventory: All clarification files are present; most items remain open-ended. Only database section 1.1 has partial answers.
- Database doc updated with decisions-to-date, open questions snapshot, and corrected action item numbering; no cross-document alignment needs identified after review.

## Summary

- Added decision and open-question snapshots to `CLARIFICATION-Database.md` for faster stakeholder review.
- Corrected action item numbering and highlighted priority dependencies.
- Consolidated meeting-ready questionnaire for all roles in `docs/MTM_Waitlist_Application/CLARIFICATION-EndUser-Interview.md` mapping directly to open clarification items.
- No changes required in other clarification documents pending stakeholder answers.
- Next steps: collect answers on zone management, audit scope, auto-assignment rules, Infor Visual validation approach, archival strategy, and the new interview checklist items.
