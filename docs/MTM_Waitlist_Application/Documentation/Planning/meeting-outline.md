Module-Based App Development Meeting
Summary

Module-Based App Development Overview 0:02

Speaker 1 explains the need to record the meeting for future reference.

Discussion begins with Dan about avoiding proprietary data issues.

The app will connect to the MySQL server for data storage and pull information from the Visual server.

Speaker 1 describes the module-based app structure, where each module (e.g., material handlers, setup texts) is self-contained and independent.

Module Examples and Functionality 1:06

Speaker 3 asks for an example of a module, and Speaker 1 describes a receiving application.

Speaker 1 explains the concept of a login module and its self-reliant nature.

The app will have modules for different tasks, such as receiving labels, dunnage labels, and UPS.

Speaker 1 introduces the idea of a guided wizard for operators to simplify tasks.

Access and Analytics Rights 5:41

Speaker 1 discusses the ability to view and edit specific modules without affecting others.

Operators will have access to the wait list but not the analytics rights.

The app will allow production leads to add custom modules for specific needs.

Speaker 1 mentions the need for Visual to store certain data for better integration.

Material Handling and Workflow Improvements 8:42

Speaker 4 suggests a "recent" tab for material handlers to quickly access frequently used items.

Speaker 1 agrees and adds the idea of a "favorites" tab for common tasks.

Discussion about simplifying tasks for press operators and material handlers.

Speaker 1 proposes auto-assigning tasks based on location and zone delegation for material handlers.

Quality Control and Communication 13:58

Speaker 1 suggests a module for operators to add quality tasks directly to the wait list.

Speaker 4 mentions current issues with quality control and the need for better communication.

Discussion about emailing quality alerts and the potential use of intercom messages.

Speaker 1 proposes integrating the app with the intercom system for real-time quality alerts.

Training and Implementation 18:58

Speaker 1 emphasizes the need for thorough training for new press operators.

The app will integrate with Visual to simplify work orders and reduce errors.

Speaker 1 mentions the importance of data collection for future improvements.

Discussion about the timeline for rolling out the new app and the need for approval from management.

Data Collection and Reporting 22:27

Speaker 1 explains the process of setting default times for job types and adjusting them based on data.

The app will allow leads to adjust times for specific jobs.

Discussion about the impact of the new app on different buildings and work orders.

Speaker 1 proposes using site IDs to differentiate between locations and improve data accuracy.

Handling Miscellaneous Tasks 27:51

Speaker 1 discusses the need for a "quick add" button for material handlers to log non-wait list tasks.

The app will allow operators to log in and out of specific tasks, providing a data trail.

Discussion about the importance of data collection for back-end tasks.

Speaker 1 mentions the need for ongoing training and updates to the app.

Final Thoughts and Next Steps 33:05

Speaker 1 asks if there are any final questions or additional ideas.

The team discusses the importance of simplifying tasks and improving communication.

Speaker 1 emphasizes the need for collaboration and input from all team members.

The meeting concludes with a plan to compile the discussed ideas into a mockup for further development.
