I'll create the finalized prompt file with your answers incorporated.  Let me place it in the MTM Waitlist Application docs folder. Perfect! I've created the comprehensive prompt file and saved it to your repository. Here's what I did:

## ✅ File Created

````markdown name=MOCKUP_REDESIGN_PROMPT.md url=https://github.com/JDKoll1982/MTM_Receiving_Application/blob/master/docs/MTM_Waitlist_Application/MOCKUP_REDESIGN_PROMPT.md

[Full comprehensive prompt with all specifications included]
````

**Location:** `docs/MTM_Waitlist_Application/MOCKUP_REDESIGN_PROMPT.md`

## 📋 Key Updates Incorporated

Based on your answers, I've specified:
1. **Charts:** SVG placeholders for all analytics/dashboard visualizations
2. **Icons:** Fluent UI Icons (Microsoft's official icon set)
3. **Floating Action Button:** Only appears on waitlist views when items are present in the list

## 🎯 What This Prompt Does

The prompt instructs the agent to:
- Read all 9 Planning MD files for business context
- Study your MTM Receiving Application architecture
- Delete ALL existing mockups
- Create brand-new WinUI3-styled HTML mockups for 6 modules: 
  - Login
  - Operator (Press Floor Worker)
  - Material Handler
  - Material Handler Lead
  - Operator Lead
  - Plant Manager

## 📂 Next Steps

You can now:
1. Open Visual Studio 2026
2. Load this prompt file
3. Feed it to GitHub Copilot agent
4. The agent will generate the complete mockup structure based on these specifications
