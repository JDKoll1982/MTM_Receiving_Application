## Section 1: Getting and Managing Tasks

### 1.1 How Should Tasks Get Assigned to You?

**Question:** We're considering different ways to assign work. What makes the most sense?

**Options:**
- System auto-assigns based on rules (you can't refuse)
- System assigns but you can reject if there's a good reason
- Tasks go to a queue and you claim what you want
- Lead assigns tasks manually
- Mix (auto-assign normally, Lead can override)
- Other idea: _______________________

> **Example:**  
> Auto-assign might put the next task to whoever's least busy. Self-claim lets you pick based on where you are. Lead assignment gives them control for urgent stuff.

**Your Answer:**

**Decided By:** _________________ __Date:** _____________

### 1.2 Auto-Assignment Rules (If Using Auto-Assign)

**Question:** If the system auto-assigns, what rule should it use?

**Pick your preferred approach:**
- [ ] **Round-robin:** Everyone gets tasks in rotation (fair but might not be efficient)
- [ ] **Least busy:** Goes to whoever has the fewest active tasks
- [ ] **Zone-based:** Goes to whoever is already in or closest to that zone
- [ ] **Skill match:** Certain handlers get certain types of tasks
- [ ] **Combo:** Least busy in the right zone, Lead can override for urgent
- [ ] Other: _______________________

> **Example:**  
> "Least busy in the correct zone" - if you're already in Zone 1 and not swamped, you get the next Zone 1 task. But your Lead can grab it and assign it to someone specific if it's critical.

**Your Answer:**

**Decided By:** _________________ **Date:** _____________

### 1.3 Can You Reject or Return a Task?

**Question:** If you get assigned a task you can't do, can you reject it?

**Should you be able to reject if:**
- [ ] Equipment isn't working (forklift dead, crane down)
- [ ] You don't have the tools/equipment needed
- [ ] It's outside your assigned zone (without permission)
- [ ] The info is wrong or missing
- [ ] Safety issue
- [ ] Other: _______________________

**When you reject, what happens:**
- Goes back to queue for someone else
- Goes to your Lead to decide
- System asks you for a reason
- Other: _______________________

> **Example:**  
> Task says deliver coils but doesn't say where. You reject it with reason "Missing location." It goes back to the requester or Lead to fix.

**Your Answer:**

**Decided By:** _________________ **Date:** _____________

---

### 1.4 Working Outside Your Zone

**Question:** Are you assigned to specific zones, and can you work in others?

**Zone assignment options:**
- You're assigned to specific zone(s) permanently
- You're assigned but can help in other zones if needed
- No zone assignments - go wherever
- Changes by shift or day
- Other: _______________________

**If zone-assigned, can you pick up tasks in other zones:**
- Yes, anytime
- Yes, with Lead approval
- Only if your zone is empty
- No
- Other: _______________________

> **Example:**  
> You're assigned to Zone 1 but it's slow. Can you claim Zone 3 tasks, or do you need your Lead to approve first?

**Your Answer:**

**Decided By:** _________________ **Date:** _____________

## Section 2: Your Dashboard/Screen

- [ ] Task timer (track how long you've been working)
- [ ] Zone map or task locations
- [ ] Quick Add button (log unscheduled work)

- [ ] By distance from your location
- [ ] You choose/toggle
- [ ] Other: _______________________

## Section 3: Working on Tasks

## Section 4: Quick Add (Unscheduled Work)

### 4.1 Logging Work Not on the Waitlist

**Question:** Should you be able to log work you did that wasn't requested?

**Examples of "Quick Add" work:**
- Restocking dunnage you noticed was low
- Delivering material to a press you were passing

- Other proactive work

**Should Quick Add be allowed:**
- Yes, always
- Yes, but requires approval from Lead
- Yes, but doesn't count toward performance metrics
- No, only log assigned work
- Other: _______________________

> **Why This Matters:**  
> Quick Add captures proactive work a Material Handler did that was not requested (e.g., picking up goods from a Press when the task to do so was not on the Waitlist). However, this must be controlled and/or monitored in order to prevent or address abuse such as false entries.

> **Example:**  
> You're walking by and notice a press is out of dunnage. You grab some and deliver it. You Quick Add it to log the work. Maybe your Lead reviews and approves it later.

**Your Answer:**

- [ ] Time spent
- [ ] Work order (if applicable)
- [ ] Reason/notes

## Section 7: Equipment and Tools

### 7.1 Tracking Equipment

**Question:** Should the app track what equipment/tools you're using?

**Should you:**
- [ ] Log what equipment you're using for each task
- [ ] Assign equipment to yourself at start of shift
- [ ] Not track equipment in this app
- [ ] Other: _______________________
