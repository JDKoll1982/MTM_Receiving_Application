## Section 1: Submitting Requests

### 1.1 What Types of Requests Should Operators Be Able to Submit?

**Question:** What kinds of help can you request through the app?

**Check all that make sense for Operators:**
- [ ] Material delivery (coils, blanks, etc.)
- [ ] Dunnage delivery (containers, pallets, etc.)
- [ ] Quality inspection
- [ ] Setup technician help
- [ ] Maintenance/repair
- [ ] Tool/die issue
- [ ] Parts to Outside Service

**Or should Operators be able to submit ANY type of request?**

> **Why This Matters:**  
> Limiting request types cuts down on wrong requests. But maybe you need flexibility to request anything.

> **Example:**  
> Press operators might request material, quality checks, and setup help. But maybe maintenance requests should go through Leads?
