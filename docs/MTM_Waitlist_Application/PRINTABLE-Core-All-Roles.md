## Section 1: Login & Access

### 4. How Should People Log In?

**Note:** All operator computers are shared workstations.

**Options:**
- ☐ Windows/AD (automatic login using computer login)
- ☐ Username and password (type it in each time)
- ☐ Hybrid (Windows where it works, username/password as backup)
- ☐ Other: ___________________________________________

> **Why This Matters:**  
> This choice affects setup cost and support needs (like password resets). Windows/AD means no passwords to manage, but needs the right network setup.

> **Example:**  
> If floor PCs are shared kiosks without AD, we'll need username/password. If supervisors use office PCs with Windows login, that could work automatically.

**Your Answer:**

```

### 5. Can One Person Have Multiple Roles?

**Question:** Can someone be assigned multiple roles at once (like both Material Handler and Material Handler Lead)?

**Options:**
- ☐ Yes - people can have multiple roles
- ☐ No - one role per person only
- ☐ Depends on the role combination
- ☐ Other: ___________________________________________

> **Why This Matters:**  
> If people can have multiple roles, it changes what screens they see and what they can do.

> **Example:**  
> A Production Lead who also runs a press during slow times might need both the Lead dashboard and the Operator screens.

**Your Answer:**

```

## Section 2: Request Requirements

### 6. What Information Is Required to Submit a Request?

**Question:** Check all fields that MUST be filled out before someone can submit a request.

**Options (check all that apply):**
- ☐ Work order number
- ☐ Part number
- ☐ Zone/location
- ☐ Priority level
- ☐ Description/notes
- ☐ Quantity needed
- ☐ Other: ___________________________________________

> **Why This Matters:**  
> Missing info means handlers have to hunt for details before they start. But too many required fields slow down creating requests.

> **Example:**  
> Without a zone, the handler doesn't know where to go. Without a work order, the request might not tie to the right job.

**Your Answer:**

```
_____________________________________________________________________________
```

**Decided By:** _________________________ **Date:** _____________

### 7. Can Requests Be Changed After Assignment?

**Question:** After a request is assigned to someone, can the requester still edit or cancel it?

**Options:**
- ☐ No changes after assignment
- ☐ Can cancel only (not edit)
- ☐ Can change until handler starts work
- ☐ Can change anytime (handler gets notified)
- ☐ Other: ___________________________________________

> **Why This Matters:**  
> Blocking changes means handlers know the request won't shift on them. Allowing changes gives flexibility for quick fixes but might mean redoing work.

> **Example:**  
> An operator submits a request for coils, then realizes they typed the wrong part number after a handler already accepted it. Can they fix it?

**Your Answer:**

```

## Section 3: Favorites & Recents

### 8. How Many Recent Requests to Keep?

**Question:** How many of a user's recent requests should be saved for quick resubmit?

> **Why This Matters:**  
> Favorites and recents make it faster to submit common requests. But too many clutter the list.

> **Example:**  
> Keep the last 10 requests for 7 days so people can quickly resubmit "Coils for Press 5".

**Your Answer:** __________ (number between 5-50)

---

### 9. How Many Days to Keep Recent Requests?

**Question:** After how many days should old requests be removed from the recents list?

**Your Answer:** __________ (days)

---

## Section 4: Session Management

### 10. Auto-Logout Time for Shared Kiosks

**Question:** How long (in minutes) should someone be able to sit idle on a shared floor kiosk before auto-logout?

> **Why This Matters:**  
> Short timeouts are more secure but might annoy people. Long timeouts are convenient but risky on shared computers.

> **Example:**  
> A kiosk on the floor might log out after 5 minutes to prevent the next person from seeing someone else's stuff.

**Your Answer:** __________ minutes (1-60)

---

### 11. Auto-Logout Time for Office PCs

**Question:** How long (in minutes) can office users (Leads, Managers) sit idle before auto-logout?
