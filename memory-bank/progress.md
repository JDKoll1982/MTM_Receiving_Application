# Progress

Last Updated: 2026-01-24

## What works
- Agent Skills HTML guide pages exist and share consistent layout/navigation:
  - `index.html`
  - `what-are-skills.html`
  - `getting-started.html`
  - `folder-structure.html`
  - `examples.html`
  - `best-practices.html`
- Shared UI resources: `styles.css` + `app.js`

- Real skill folder exists:
  - `.github/skills/mvvm-architecture-enforcer/SKILL.md`
  - `.github/skills/mvvm-architecture-enforcer/scripts/validate-mvvm.ps1`
  - `.github/skills/mvvm-architecture-enforcer/references/*`
  - `.github/skills/mvvm-architecture-enforcer/templates/*`

- Repo skill authoring standard exists:
  - `.github/instructions/skill-authoring.instructions.md`

## What's left to build
- (Optional) Add `LICENSE.txt` under `.github/skills/mvvm-architecture-enforcer/` if desired
- (Optional) Add additional skills beyond MVVM enforcer

## Known issues
- Terminal runs can lock up in the user environment; avoid terminal commands and validate via repository search/file reads.
