# Active Context

Last Updated: 2026-01-24

## Current focus
- Maintain the repository Agent Skills documentation and skill set
- Expand skill coverage as needed (e.g., DAO generator, x:Bind auditor)

## Recent changes
- Added/updated Agent Skills HTML pages under `docs/agent-skills-guide/`
- Recreated `getting-started.html` with a comprehensive skill example
- Added `folder-structure.html`, `examples.html`, and `best-practices.html`

- Created `.github/skills/mvvm-architecture-enforcer/` (SKILL.md + scripts + references + templates)
- Created `.github/instructions/skill-authoring.instructions.md`
- Updated `getting-started.html` to link to the real skill resources

## Next steps
- Consider adding a `LICENSE.txt` for the skill folder if you want explicit licensing
- Add additional skills (choose from examples) and update docs accordingly

## Decisions
- Do not create new architectural patterns; follow existing MVVM rules from `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
