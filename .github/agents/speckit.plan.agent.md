You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Outline

1. **Setup**: Run `.specify/scripts/powershell/setup-plan.ps1 -Json` from repo root and parse JSON for FEATURE_SPEC, IMPL_PLAN, SPECS_DIR, BRANCH. For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").

2. **Load context**: Read FEATURE_SPEC and `.specify/memory/constitution.md`. Load IMPL_PLAN template (already copied).

3. **Execute plan workflow**: Follow the structure in IMPL_PLAN template to:
   - Fill Technical Context (mark unknowns as "NEEDS CLARIFICATION")
   - Fill Constitution Check section from constitution
   - Evaluate gates (ERROR if violations unjustified)
   - Phase 0: Generate research.md (resolve all NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   - **Phase 0.5: Analyze Workflow Data from Spec**:
     - Read FEATURE_SPEC and extract all WORKFLOW_DATA blocks (key-value format in HTML comments: <!-- WORKFLOW_START: X.Y --> ... <!-- WORKFLOW_END: X.Y -->)
     - For each workflow block, parse:
       - WORKFLOW ID, TITLE, DIRECTION
       - DEPENDS_ON and CONFLICTS_WITH relationships
       - INTERACTION descriptions
       - All NODE definitions (name, type, shape, label)
       - All CONNECTION definitions (from/to nodes with optional labels)
     - For each workflow, identify:
       - UI components required (screens, buttons, dropdowns, data grids, notifications)
       - State management needs (session data, validation state, auto-fill tracking)
       - User interactions and event handlers (button clicks, dropdown selections, grid actions)
       - Data flow patterns (copy operations, validation checks, navigation logic)
       - Error handling requirements (confirmation dialogs, validation messages)
     - Document workflow analysis in research.md under "Workflow Analysis" section
     - Validate workflow relationships: check that DEPENDS_ON workflows exist, CONFLICTS_WITH are bidirectional
     - Suggest implementation order based on DEPENDS_ON dependencies
     - Use workflow insights to inform data-model.md entity design and contracts/ API specifications
     - Note: Actual Mermaid diagrams are generated by running: MermaidProcessor.ps1 -Action Generate
   - Phase 1: Generate data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md
   - Phase 1: Update agent context by running the agent script
   - Re-evaluate Constitution Check post-design

4. **Stop and report**: Command ends after Phase 2 planning. Report branch, IMPL_PLAN path, and generated artifacts.

## Phases

### Phase 0: Outline & Research

1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:

   ```text
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

### Phase 1: Design & Contracts

**Prerequisites:** `research.md` complete

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable
   - **Reference WORKFLOW_DATA blocks** to identify:
     - Required state properties for each workflow step
     - Data structures for bulk operations (e.g., copy source tracking, auto-fill markers)
     - Validation state tracking per load/field
     - Navigation state and edit mode tracking

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Agent context update**:
   - Run `.specify/scripts/powershell/update-agent-context.ps1 -AgentType copilot`
   - These scripts detect which AI agent is in use
   - Update the appropriate agent-specific context file
   - Add only new technology from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Key rules

- Use absolute paths
- ERROR on gate failures or unresolved clarifications
