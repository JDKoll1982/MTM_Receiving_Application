This file is a merged representation of a subset of the codebase, containing specifically included files and files not matching ignore patterns, combined into a single document by Repomix.
The content has been processed where line numbers have been added.

# File Summary

## Purpose

This file contains a packed representation of a subset of the repository's contents that is considered the most important context.
It is designed to be easily consumable by AI systems for analysis, code review,
or other automated processes.

## File Format

The content is organized as follows:

1. This summary section
2. Repository information
3. Directory structure
4. Repository files (if enabled)
5. Multiple file entries, each consisting of:
  a. A header with the file path (## File: path/to/file)
  b. The full contents of the file in a code block

## Usage Guidelines

- This file should be treated as read-only. Any changes should be made to the
  original repository files, not this packed version.
- When processing this file, use the file path to distinguish
  between different files in the repository.
- Be aware that this file may contain sensitive information. Handle it with
  the same level of security as you would the original repository.
- Pay special attention to the Repository Description. These contain important context and guidelines specific to this project.

## Notes

- Some files may have been excluded based on .gitignore rules and Repomix's configuration
- Binary files are not included in this packed representation. Please refer to the Repository Structure section for a complete list of file paths, including binary files
- Only files matching these patterns are included: **/SETTABLE_OBJECTS_REPORT.md,**/QUICK_REF.md, **/PRIVILEGES.md, **/.github/copilot-instructions.md, **/.specify/memory/constitution.md, _bmad/module-agents/agents/**/*.md, _bmad/module-agents/config/**/*.md
- Files matching these patterns are excluded: docs/user/**, docs/developer/**, **/*.cs, **/*.xaml
- Line numbers have been added to the beginning of each line
- Files are sorted by Git change count (files with more changes are at the bottom)
