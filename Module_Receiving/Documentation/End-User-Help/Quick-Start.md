## Before You Begin

**You'll need**:
- MTM Receiving Application installed and running
- Your login credentials
- A purchase order number to receive
- Physical materials in front of you

**Optional but helpful**:
- Packing slip from the shipment
- Scale for weighing (if applicable)
- Barcode scanner (if available)

## Your First Receive (Step-by-Step)

### Step 1: Open Receiving (30 seconds)

1. Launch **MTM Receiving Application**
2. Log in with your credentials
3. From the main menu, click **"Receiving"**
4. You'll see three options—click **"Guided Wizard"**

> **What you see**: Mode Selection screen with three big buttons

---

### Step 2: Enter the PO Number (30 seconds)

1. Look at your packing slip for the **Purchase Order Number**
   - Example: "PO-123456" or just "123456"
2. Type it into the **PO Number** field
3. Press **Enter** or click **Next**
4. Wait a moment while the system looks it up

> **What you see**: System shows part description, expected quantity, and supplier

**If you get an error**:
- Check for typos in the PO number
- Try without the "PO-" prefix
- Ask your supervisor to verify the PO exists in the system

---

### Step 3: Select Parts (30 seconds)

> **Skip this step if**: Your PO has only one part—system proceeds automatically

1. Review the list of parts on the PO
2. Check the boxes for parts you're receiving **today**
3. Leave unchecked any parts not in this shipment
4. Click **Next**

> **What you see**: List of parts with checkboxes, descriptions, and quantities

**Example**: PO has 3 parts, but only 2 arrived today—check only the 2 that came.

---

### Step 4: How Many Loads? (30 seconds)

1. Count your physical containers:
   - How many pallets?
   - How many boxes?
   - How many crates?
2. Enter that total number in **"Number of Loads"**
3. Click **Next**

> **What you see**: Simple text field asking for a number

**Example**: Materials arrived on 2 pallets and 1 box = Enter **3**

**One load = One label**: Each container gets its own tracking label.

---

### Step 5: Fill in Details for Each Load (2-3 minutes)

For each load, enter:

1. **Quantity**: How many pieces in this container
   - Count them or check the packing slip
2. **Weight** (optional): How much does it weigh?
   - Leave blank if you don't have a scale
3. **Heat/Lot** (if applicable): Batch or lot number
   - Check the parts or packing slip
   - Leave blank if not applicable
4. **Package Type**: Select from dropdown
   - Pallet, Box, Crate, etc.
   - Pick what matches your physical container

Move between fields with **Tab** key (faster than clicking).

When all loads are complete, click **Next**.

> **What you see**: Form with fields for each load number

**Example for Load 1**:
- Quantity: 500
- Weight: 120 lbs
- Heat/Lot: HT-2025-001
- Package Type: Pallet

---

### Step 6: Review Everything (30 seconds)

1. Double-check the summary screen:
   - Is the PO number correct?
   - Are part numbers right?
   - Do quantities match what arrived?
   - Are package types accurate?
2. If something is wrong, click **Back** to fix it
3. When everything looks good, click **Save**

> **What you see**: Complete summary of your receive

---

### Step 7: Wait for Confirmation (15 seconds)

1. System shows **"Saving..."** message
2. Files are created and data is saved
3. You'll see **"Save Successful"** message
4. Labels should print automatically (if configured)

> **What you see**: Progress indicator, then green success message

**If save fails**:
- Note the error message
- Your data is still saved in a session
- Contact IT for help—don't re-enter everything

---

### Step 8: Apply Labels (1-2 minutes)

1. Retrieve labels from printer
2. Match label number to load number
   - Label 1 goes on Load 1
   - Label 2 goes on Load 2, etc.
3. Apply labels to corresponding containers
4. Move materials to designated area

> **You're done!** Materials are now in the system and ready for next steps.

---

## What Happens Next?

After you save:
- **Database**: Your receive is permanently recorded
- **Routing**: System determines where materials should go
- **Labels**: Warehouse knows how to track these containers
- **Reporting**: Receive shows up in receiving reports
- **Inventory**: Part quantities are updated

**You don't need to do anything else**—the receive is complete.
