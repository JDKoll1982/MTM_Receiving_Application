## Constitution Compliance Review

**Required before PR approval**: Verify alignment with [Project Constitution](.specify/memory/constitution.md)

### Core Principles
- [ ] CONST001 MVVM Architecture: ViewModels have logic, Views are markup-only, no business logic in code-behind
- [ ] CONST002 Database Layer: All DAOs return Model_Dao_Result, use stored procedures, are async
- [ ] CONST003 Dependency Injection: Services registered in App.xaml.cs with interfaces
- [ ] CONST004 Error Handling: IService_ErrorHandler and ILoggingService used consistently
- [ ] CONST005 Security: Authentication/authorization properly implemented with audit trail
- [ ] CONST006 WinUI 3: x:Bind used, ObservableCollection, async/await for I/O
- [ ] CONST007 Specification-Driven: Feature follows Speckit workflow (spec → plan → tasks)

### Critical Constraints
- [ ] CONST008 Infor Visual: If querying VISUAL/MTMFG, connection is READ ONLY (ApplicationIntent=ReadOnly)
- [ ] CONST009 Infor Visual: No INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE/DDL operations on Infor Visual
- [ ] CONST010 MySQL 5.7.24: No JSON functions, CTEs, window functions, CHECK constraints

### Forbidden Practices
- [ ] CONST011 No direct SQL queries in C# code
- [ ] CONST012 No exceptions thrown from DAO layer
- [ ] CONST013 No service locator pattern or static service access
- [ ] CONST014 No `{Binding}` used instead of `x:Bind`
