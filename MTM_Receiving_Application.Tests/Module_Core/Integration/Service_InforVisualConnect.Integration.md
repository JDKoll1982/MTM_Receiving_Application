# Service_InforVisualConnect Integration Notes

Last Updated: 2025-01-19

## Scope
Infor Visual queries require SQL Server access and prepared SQL files. Full verification must run against a test database.

## Proposed Tests
- Validate connection with live SQL Server
- Verify PO and part queries return expected data
- Validate error handling when PO or part not found
